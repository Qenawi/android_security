# Cooperative multitasking Sys :
individual executing tasks release CPU resources by
"yielding" , allowing other tasks to be executed with intention to be resumed
later
----------
yielding vs termination - >
when task is yielded processor PC<Program counter> moved to another
task with in different instruction <instruction [i]> and once a task with in instruction[i] is yielded processor will resume first yielded task from first instruction
-----------
benefits  of cooperative :
user can switch between different applications
------------------
issues :
if a single task miss-behaves and didn't yield it will consume processor resources for a long time and block other tasks

ex on OS : windows 3.1
