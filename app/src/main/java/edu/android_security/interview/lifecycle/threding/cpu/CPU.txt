CPu - > Central processing unit  , its black box we dont need to know how its built
------
1000 1001 1101 1000 -> CPU
# CPU input [1000 1001 1101 1000] is sequace of bits
# each  sequance  of bits  is called command
# example for command Move content of register BX into Register AX
= Register = CPU internal storage

# commands that cpu  know how to interact with called instructions as cpu dont deal with random commands
----------
# Machine Code is ordered sequence of instructions
= [instruction 1][instruction 2][instruction 3][instruction 4]
Machine code is sequance of instructions and instruction  is set of commands and command is set of bits
-------
Compiler playes key role in
converting higlvl language (human readable) to Machine code which could be read and
executed by cpu
---------------------------------
CPU operations
# cpu take machine code as input and based on instructions it interact with io & memory
= Machine Code =>  CPU <-> [ memory , io ]
