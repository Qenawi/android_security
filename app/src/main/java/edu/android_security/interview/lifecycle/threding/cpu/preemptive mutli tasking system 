Preemptive multi tasking execution example :
OOperating system mange cpu resources by allocating cpu time slices to different tasks according to its own scheduling
algorithm
-------------------------------------------
how concurrency work on preemptive multitask system
os say to individual task its your time to run and then pause it and resume or start another task
------------------------------------
advantages:
allow concurrency and make sure that system remain responsive as os it self pause and resume task based on complex logic that we don't
have to deal with
